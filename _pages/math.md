Notes
======
One of the passes I do when studying math is typing up notes. It was my intention for these to 
be highly self-referential and something I could add to over time. 
* Banach spaces (16 pages) ([pdf](/files/banach_spaces_notes.pdf))
* C*-algebras (23 pages) ([pdf](/files/cstar_algebras_notes.pdf))
* measure theory (21 pages) ([pdf](/files/measure_theory_notes.pdf))
* commutative algebra (23 pages) ([pdf](/files/commutative_algebra_notes.pdf))
* algebraic geometry (24 pages) ([pdf](/files/algebraic_geometry_notes.pdf))

Papers
======
* _Bounded Adjointable Operators on Dense Subspaces of Separable Hilbert Spaces_, Undergraduate Senior Thesis, ongoing ([pdf](/files/senior_thesis.pdf))
* _(co)Ends and Day Convolution_, Dartmouth Undergraduate Journal of Science, Spring 2021 ([odf](/files/dujs_dayconv.pdf))
  
Other
======
I have a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvYCMicLA7TZNfYhOaSCOsw) I'm proud of. My goal isn't to seem like an expert 
on the things I talk about, but to learn through teaching.

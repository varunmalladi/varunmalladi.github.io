Notes
======
One of the passes I do when studying math is typing up notes. It was my intention for these to 
be highly self-referential and something I could add to over time. You can find some of my notes (along with their LaTeX source code and styles) [here](https://github.com/treemcgee42/math-notes).

Papers
======
* _Bounded Adjointable Operators on Dense Subspaces of Separable Hilbert Spaces_, Undergraduate Senior Thesis ([pdf](/files/senior_thesis.pdf))
* _(co)Ends and Day Convolution_, Dartmouth Undergraduate Journal of Science, Spring 2021 ([pdf](/files/dujs_dayconv.pdf))
  
Other
======
I have a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvYCMicLA7TZNfYhOaSCOsw) I'm proud of. My goal isn't to seem like an expert 
on the things I talk about, but to learn through teaching.

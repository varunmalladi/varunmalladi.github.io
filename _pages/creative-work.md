# Dartmouth digital arts
_Maya_

I took 3D modelling (CS22) and 3D Animation (CS24) at Dartmouth. Here are a few things I made.

## Custom biped 

I modelled and rigged a spaceman, and animated the following short video with it:

</div>

## Abstract

There were no hard rules to follow for this one, so I built off the biped I was making.

<div align=center>
  <img src="../images/spaceman.jpg" alt=""  width="50%" height="50%">
</div>
<br>

I was trying to express how I feel when I'm doing mathâ€” there's so much beautiful complexity and you're just
trying your best to contain it in a way you can understand and use.

## Room

One of my favorite movies, and one that heavily influenced the aesthethic I'm drawn to, is _Tron: Legacy_.
For this assignment I tried to recreate a room from it.

<div align=center>

</div>
<br>

This was my first assignment in the class, and there are a number of things I wish I would have done better.
I had initially intended to include a lightcycle, but it turned out to be beyond my skillset at the time. I 
also think I could have played more with the shadows and color, to make parts of the scene pop out more.

## Animation Short Movie

For our final project in animation class we could pick a model and create a very short movie with it, something
that communicated a change in emotion.

</div>
<br>

One of my biggest influences in animation has to be Tom and Jerry, and I tried to draw on the way Tom would 
sneak around and jump off screen.

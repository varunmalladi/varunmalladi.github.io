Hi! My name is Varun (Rooney) and I'm currently a junior at Dartmouth College studying mathematics. If you'd asked me six months ago about the specific areas of mathematics I wish to pursue, I would've said infinity-categories or stable homotopy theory. Now I'm not so sure— I've become highly interested in aspects of analysis such as linear PDE's, differential operators, and D-modules. My field of view is broadening...

I have a [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvYCMicLA7TZNfYhOaSCOsw) that is very important to me. Teaching is something I find really fulfilling. Check it out!

Aside from mathematics, I enjoy developing software, particularly low-level programs. And aside from even that, I try writing every now and then.

Hi!
===

My name is Varun (Runi) and I recently completed by undergraduate study at Dartmouth College with a major in mathematics and minor in computer science. 

In terms of math, I'm currently interested in functional analysis, particularly operator and C*-algebras. I'm hoping to eventually get into noncommutative geometry. Check out the [Math tab](/math) above for more.

In terms of programming, I particularly enjoy working with low-level programs. Compilers and graphics are two areas I'm interested in at the moment. Check out the [Programming tab](/programming) above to see what I've been working on.

I also draw and write!

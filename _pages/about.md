# Hi!

My name is Varun (Runi) and I'm currently a senior at Dartmouth College studying mathematics and computer science. Right now I'm interested in functional analysis, particularly operator and C*-algebras. I'm hoping to eventually get into noncommutative geometry. Check out the [Math tab](/math) above for more.

Aside from mathematics, I enjoy developing software, particularly low-level programs. Compilers and graphics are two areas I'm interested in at the moment. Check out the [Programming tab](/programming) above to see what I've been working on.

I also draw and write!
